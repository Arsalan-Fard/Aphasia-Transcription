okay, so first i'm just gonna be asking you to do some talking. okay. so how do you think your speech is these days?  i believe it's better. but, i mostly have problems when i get excited or i, want to. i, want to get it out fast. i used to be very fast talking, you know, and it's hard to sew it down, you know, so much. yeah, i understand. i'm a fast talker too. so do you remember when you had your stroke? well, i was asleep, and i woke up with it. oh. okay. could, you tell me about it?  well,  i woke up and,  sit up and, it didn't feel strange or anything. and i got up to go to the bathroom, and i couldn't get my arm to do something, and i did. it didn't really dawn on me, you know, so i came out and tried to make a coffee. and i just couldn't make it. and i, turned around and i fell. and i didn't understand why i fell. and, i went back in the room. my granddaughter, was spending the night. and, i decided that,  i needed some help, you know? and, i tried to call my son, but i didn't. i didn't work, you know, and my daughter came up and i called her. all i could say was, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, that's all i could say.   and, then after i fell again and my daughter,  i mean, my granddaughter, took my phone and ran out here and called her dad, you know, so that was, you know, they got the ambulance and everything, so that's good. she was there. yeah. well, i think she was afraid because she, come out of the bedroom and stayed back here waiting for them, you know, she didn't. yeah. hello, tushy? i don't know. 10, 11? yeah. okay, then. yeah. scary, but. well, i'm glad to hear that. i'm getting better at those. that's actually the next question, i think. yes. okay. so, i'd like to hear about your recovery and what kinds of things you've done to try and get better since your stroke. well, the main thing is my speech, you know, other than that, i'd say i'm m. fairly,  okay. you know, the weakness. but it's not terrible.   i took therapy, you know, and i. i, go to the gym, and do water, aerobics and some treadmill.  and, that's, you know, it. that's it. i don't do, therapy anymore because i can't afford it, you know?  i,  i like to read, but i don't like it now. you know, i used to like to read two or three books a week, you know. yeah. and i,  there's a book i've had since, beginning of september, and i still haven't finished it yet, you know, but i try to read out loud and some, words that i can't pronounce. i stay on them until i can pronounce them right.  i wish i did better, you know, reading more, but i just, you know, i just can't. yeah.  i like it because,  i like what i'm reading, but, it's hard. have you tried books on tape? that's bad to ask. well, no, but used, to. i didn't like books on tape. my mind starts to wonder, you know, so. but. and that is good for me, you know, to. to get through it. yeah. to read it aloud, you know, so. yeah, that makes sense. yeah. my mind wanders when i listen to things, too. yeah. yeah. unless it's like a podcast while i'm driving or. yeah, i have to be doing something else. yeah. well, i can do it while driving, you know, but i don't drive that much, so, you know. yeah. yeah. okay, so i'm going to ask a couple things that also are just some more talking. please talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in knowing about your language. okay.  so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? it could be happy or sad, and it can be from when you were little, or it could be more recently. okay.  well, i had my last baby in the car. and, i had, two labor pains, and that was it. she was delivered, you know, we were in the parking lot of a bank trying to get some money to put gas in the car. wow. yeah, but, you know, she was fine, you know.  she was their third one, so, you know, we pretty much knew what was the deal. yeah. better than if it was the first one. yes. we'd all have been dead, you know? do you have netflix? yes. have you heard of seth meyers? yes. he has a show or a special called lobby baby about his wife accidentally gave birth in their apartment lobby in new york. as it happened so fast, she started the pain. m. and then by the time they got to the lobby, it was time. m. yeah. yeah. it sounds similar. it's called precipitous labor. but you know, i just had one, i had one pain and i got everybody up and ready and i had another pain. when i reach the car and then, you know,  yeah, but then i push, so. yeah. wow, that's creepy. how many kids do you have? three. okay. okay, so that was the last. yeah, yeah. okay. okay, so for this next part, i'm going to show you some pictures and then going to ask you to talk about them. okay. so take a little bit of time to look at those pictures. they tell a story. mhm. so if you look at all of them, then i'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, middle and end. and you can look at the pictures while you tell the story. okay, well, the boy kicks the ball, he kicked it through the window. the dad, i guess the dad catches it and looks out the window. yep, yep. yeah, sorry. there's very elaborate instructions to read for these. i know that you get it a lot sooner than when i finish saying it. okay, so same thing with this one. there's also a story. and then just tell me a beginning, middle and end when you're ready. the mother wants him to use an umbrella and he said, i don't need it. and she, when he gets outside, it's raining and raining bad, and he comes back to his mother and said, i need an umbrella. and you know, there's the umbrella. astoria. are you familiar with feeling that way? did your kids ever not listen to you? oh yeah. yeah. okay, so this is the last picture. so there's a lot going on. look at everything that's happening and then tell me again a story about what you see with the beginning, middle and end, if you can. well, the dog is barking, that's why the guy is in the tree. and the cat is in the tree missing. i mean, the girl wants her cat and the fire truck is there. i don't know if she's going to get the dog or the cat down, you know, probably both. yep, yep. yeah, i feel like cats are stubborn. i think just waiting like this. yeah, i don't think anything's gonna happen. okay, so next i'm gonna ask you to tell a story. okay, so have you ever heard the story of cinderella yet?

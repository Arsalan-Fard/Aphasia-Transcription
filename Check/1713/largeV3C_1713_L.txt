 okay, so first i'm just going to be asking you to do some talking. okay. so how do you think your speech is these days? i believe it's better, but i mostly have problems when i get excited or i want to, i want to get it out fast. i used to be very fast talking, you know, and it's hard to sew it down, you know, so much. yeah, i understand. i'm a fast talker too. so, do you remember when you had your stroke? well, i was asleep and i woke up with it. oh, okay. could you tell me about it? well, i woke up and sit up and it didn't feel strange or anything and i got up to go to the bathroom and i couldn't get my arm to do something and it didn't really dawn on me, you know. so i came out and tried to make a coffee and i just couldn't make it. and i turned around and i fell and i didn't understand why i fell. and i went back in the room. my granddaughter was spending the night. and i decided that i needed some help, you know. and i tried to call my son, but i didn't work, you know. and my daughter came up, and i called her. and all i could say was, yeah, yeah, yeah. you know, that's all i could say. and then after i fell again, and my daughter, i mean my granddaughter, took my phone and ran out here and called her dad, you know. so that was, you know, they got the ambulance and everything. that's good she was there. yeah. well, i think she was afraid because she come out of the bedroom and stayed back here waiting for them. you know, she didn't, yeah. how old was she? i don't know, 10, 11. yeah. oh, okay. yeah, scary. but, well, i'm glad to hear that. it's been getting better. that's actually the next question i think yes okay so i'd like to hear about your recovery and what kinds of things you've done to try and get better since your stroke well the main thing is my speech you know other than that i i'd say i'm i'm fairly okay, you know, the weakness, but it's not terrible. i took therapy you know and i go to the gym and do a water aerobics and some treadmill and that's you know it that's it i don't do therapy anymore because i can't afford it you you know, i like to read, but i don't like it now. you know, i used to like to read two or three books a week, you know. yeah, and there's a book i've had since the beginning of september, and i still haven't finished it yet, you know. but i try to read out loud and some words that i can't pronounce i stay on them until i can pronounce them right i wish i did better reading more but i just can't yeah, i like it because i like what i'm reading, you know, but it's hard. yeah. have you tried books on tape? well, no, but used to, i didn't like books on tape. you know, my mind starts to wonder, you know. so but and that is good for me you know to get through it yeah to read it aloud you know so yeah that makes sense yeah my mind wanders when i listen to things too yeah yeah unless it's like a podcast while i'm driving or yeah i have to be doing something else yeah well i can do it while driving, you know, but i don't drive that much. right. so, you know. yeah, yeah. okay, so i'm going to ask a couple things that also are just some more talking. please talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in knowing about your language. okay. so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life?

 Okay, so first I'm just going to be asking you to do some talking. Okay. So how do you think your speech is these days? I believe it's better, but I mostly have problems when I get excited or I want to, I want to get it out fast. I used to be very fast talking, you know, and it's hard to sew it down, you know, so much. Yeah, I understand. I'm a fast talker too. So, do you remember when you had your stroke? Well, I was asleep and I woke up with it. Oh, okay. Could you tell me about it? Well, I woke up and sit up and it didn't feel strange or anything and I got up to go to the bathroom and I couldn't get my arm to do something and it didn't really dawn on me, you know. So I came out and tried to make a coffee and I just couldn't make it. And I turned around and I fell and I didn't understand why I fell. And I went back in the room. My granddaughter was spending the night. And I decided that I needed some help, you know. And I tried to call my son, but I didn't work, you know. And my daughter came up, and I called her. And all I could say was, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, that's all I could say. And then after I fell again, and my daughter, I mean my granddaughter, took my phone and ran out here and called her dad, you know. So that was, you know, they got the ambulance and everything. That's good she was there. Yeah. Well, I think she was afraid because she come out of the bedroom and stayed back here waiting for them. You know, she didn't, yeah. How old was she? I don't know, 10, 11. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, scary. But, well, I'm glad to hear that. It's been getting better. that's actually the next question I think yes okay so um I'd like to hear about your recovery and what kinds of things you've done to try and get better since your stroke um well the main thing is my speech you know other than that I I'd say I'm I'm fairly okay, you know, the weakness, but it's not terrible. I took therapy you know and I go to the gym and do a water aerobics and some treadmill and that's you know it that's it I don't do therapy anymore because I can't afford it you You know, I like to read, but I don't like it now. You know, I used to like to read two or three books a week, you know. Yeah, and there's a book I've had since the beginning of September, and I still haven't finished it yet, you know. but I try to read out loud and some words that I can't pronounce I stay on them until I can pronounce them right I wish I did better reading more but I just can't Yeah, I like it because I like what I'm reading, you know, but it's hard. Yeah. Have you tried books on tape? Well, no, but used to, I didn't like books on tape. You know, my mind starts to wonder, you know. so but and that is good for me you know to get through it yeah to read it aloud you know so yeah that makes sense yeah my mind wanders when I listen to things too yeah yeah unless it's like a podcast while I'm driving or yeah I have to be doing something else yeah well um I can do it while driving, you know, but I don't drive that much. Right. So, you know. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I'm going to ask a couple things that also are just some more talking. Please talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in knowing about your language. Okay. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad, and it can be from when you were little, or it could be more recently. Okay. Well, I had my last baby in the car. Oh, wow. And I had two labor pains, and that was it. and she was delivered, you know, we were in the parking lot of a bank trying to get some money to put gas in the car. Wow. Yeah, but, you know, she was fine, you know. She was the third one, so, you know, we pretty much knew what was the deal. yeah better than if it was the first one yes we'd all have been dead you know have um do you have netflix yes have you heard of seth myers yes he has a show or a special called lobby baby about his wife accidentally gave birth in their apartment lobby in new york because it happened so fast she started the pain and then by the time they got to the lobby it was it was time yeah yeah it sounds similar it uh it's called precipitous labor but you know i just had one i had one pain and i got everybody up and ready and i had another pain when I reach the car and then, you know, yeah, but then I push, so. Yeah. Wow. How many kids do you have? Three. Oh, okay. Okay, so that was the last one. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So for this next part, I'm going to show you some pictures and then I'm going to ask you to talk about them. Okay. So take a little bit of time to look at those pictures. They tell a story. And so if you look at all of them, then I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end. And you can look at the pictures while you tell the story. Okay. oh well the boy kicks the ball he kicked it to the window um the dad i guess the dad catches it and looks out the window yep yep yeah yeah sorry there's very elaborate instructions i know that you get it a lot sooner than when i finish saying it okay so same thing with this one um there's um also a story and then just tell me a beginning middle and end when you're ready um she um the mother was wants him to use an umbrella and he said I don't need it and she um when he gets outside it's raining and raining bad and he comes back to his mother and said I need an umbrella and you know there's the umbrella a story are you familiar with feeling that way with your kids ever not listen to you oh yeah yeah Okay, so this is the last picture. So there's a lot going on. Look at everything that's happening, and then tell me again a story about what you see with the beginning, middle, and end, if you can. Well, the dog is barking. That's why the guy is in the tree. and the cat is in the tree. Missing, I mean, the girl wants her cat and the fire truck is there. I don't know if she's going to get the dog or the cat down, you know, probably both. yep yep yeah i feel like cats are stubborn i think just waiting like this yeah i don't think anything's gonna happen okay so next i'm gonna ask you to tell a story okay so have you ever heard the story of cinderella yeah okay so i have the pictures from the story of cinderella and I'm going to have you look through them and then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story in your own words. Okay. So go ahead and just flip through and you'll tell me the story after you look through them. Okay. Okay. I'll never, I mean, I'll never remember Fairy Godmother and everything. Thank you. Okay. So there's always details I forget to, until I flip through. Okay, so now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details that you know about the story, as well as the pictures you just looked at. Okay. Cinderella was, well, her mother died, and her father took care of her, and she needed a mother, so she got a stepmother. but she wasn't very nice and the father died and ever since the father died she was real mean to Cinderella and made her do the work around the house she had two stepsisters who were just as mean to her one day the palace put out put out an invitation to every maiden in the land to come to see if the prince was interested and she Cinderella wanted to go so she busied herself all up with you know the preparations and secretly she made a dress and it was time to leave and they said there was some things on her gown that were her sister's. You know, like the ribbons and stuff like that. And anyway, she tore it to shreds. And so the stepmother and stepsisters, you know, took off for the ball, and Cinderella cried, and suddenly she saw a fairy godmother, godmother, and she gave, no, she didn't, no. Well, anyway, she gave her a pretty dress to wear, and she made a pumpkin into a coach, and she made field mice into footmen. And she said, be back by 12 o'clock, you know. And Cinderella went to the ball, and she danced with the prince and everything and it struck midnight and she had to get away and anyway she got away but by the time she went by the time she got back her clothes were all gone and the coat and all had disappeared. But only she had one slipper, a gold slipper. And anyway... Sorry, your dog is... That's why I'm laughing. And anyway, the call went out that the prince was looking for someone to fit in this life. And the stepmother and the stepsisters were ready for them. And they came, but it didn't fit them. and anyway Cinderella come and I anyway Cinderella came and she tried the slipper on and you know they lived happy out there after you know yeah you had great details in there too I forgot I didn't even remember the whole that the sisters it was their ribbons and things that was why they said that they could that was great every time I hear someone tell this I learn more than what I previously knew okay so I have one last talking thing and then we'll go on to the language test so this is a little different tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

 okay, so first i'm just gonna be asking you to do some talking. okay, so how do you think your speeches these days? i believe it's better, but i mostly have problems when i get excited or i want to... i want to get it out fast. i used to be very fast talking, you know, and it's hard. do sew it down, you know, so much. i understand i'm a fast worker too. so, do you remember when you had your stroke? well, i was asleep and i woke up with it. oh, okay. could you tell me about it? well, i woke up and sit up and it didn't feel strange or anything and i got up to go to the bathroom and i couldn't get my arm to do something and i did it really dawn on me, you know. so i came out and tried to make a coffee and i just couldn't make it and i turned around and i fell and i didn't understand why i fell and i went back in the room my granddaughter was spending the night and i decided that i needed some help. and i tried to call my son, but i didn't work. and my daughters came up and i called her. and all i could say was, yeah, yeah. that's all i could say. and then after i spell again, and my daughter, i mean my granddaughter, took my phone and ran out here and called her dad, you know. so that was, you know, that got the ambulance and everything, so. that's good she was there. yeah. well, i think she was afraid because she... come out of the bedroom and stayed back here waiting for them. you know, she didn't. yeah. hello, toshi. i don't know, ten, eleven. yeah. okay. i'm glad to hear that. it's been getting better than those. that's actually the next question, i think. yes. okay. so, i'd like to hear about your recovery. and what kinds of things you've done to try and get better since your stroke? well, the main thing is my speech, you know, other than that, i'd say i'm fairly okay, you know, the weakness, but it's not terrible. i took therapy, you know, and i go to the gym and do a water aerobics and some treadmill. and that's it. i don't do therapy anymore because i can't afford it. i like to read, but i don't like it now. i used to like to read it two or three books a week. there's a book i've had since the beginning of september and i still haven't finished it yet. but i try to read out loud. and some words that i can't pronounce, i stay on them until i can pronounce them right. i wish i did better, you know, reading more, but i just, you know, i just can't. yeah, i like it because i like what i'm reading, you know, but it's hard. have you tried books on tape? well, no, but used to, i didn't like books on tape. you know, my mind starts to wonder, you know, so, but and that is good for me. you know. to get through it. yeah. to read it aloud. you know, so. yeah, that makes sense. yeah, my mind wanders when i listen to things too. yeah, yeah. unless it's like a podcast while i'm driving or you have to be doing something else. yeah, well i'm... i can do it while driving, you know, but i don't drive that much. so, you know. yeah, yeah. okay, so i'm gonna ask a couple of things that also are just some more talking. and please talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in knowing about your language. okay. so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? it could be happy or sad. and it could be from when you're little or it could be more recently. okay. well, i had my last baby in the car. oh. wow. and i had two labor pains and that was it. and she was delivered, you know. were in the parking lot of a bank trying to get some money to put gas in the car. wow. yeah. but, you know, she was fine. you know, she was the third one. so, you know, we pretty much knew what was the deal. yeah, better than if it was the first one. yes. we'd all have been dead. do you have netflix? yes. have you heard of seth meyers? yes. he has a show or a special... called lobby baby, and that was wife accidentally gave birth in their apartment lobby in new york. because it happened so fast, she started the pain. and then by the time they got to the lobby, it was time. yeah. yeah. so it sounds similar. it's called percipital labor, but you know, i just had one, i had one pain. and i got everybody up and ready and i had another pain when i reached the car and then, you know, yeah, but then i pushed, so. wow, let's see. how many could you have? three. okay. okay, so that was the last one. yeah, yeah. okay, so for this next part, i'm gonna show you some pictures and then gonna ask you to talk about them. okay. so take a little bit of time to look at those pictures. they tell a story.  and so if you look at all of them, then i'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end. and you can look at the pictures while you tell the story. okay. well, the boy kicks the ball. he kicked it to the window. the dad, i guess the dad catches it and looks at the window. yeah, yep. yeah. sorry, they're very elaborate instructions. i know that you get it a lot sooner than when i finish saying it. okay. so same thing with this one. there's also a story and then just tell me a beginning, middle, and end when you're ready. the mother wants him to use an umbrella and he said, i don't need it. and when he gets outside it's raining and raining bad. and he comes back to his mother and said, i need an umbrella. and, you know, there's the umbrella. are you familiar with feeling that way? if your kids ever not listen to you. oh, yeah, yeah. so this is the last picture. there's a lot going on. look at everything that's happening, and then tell me again a story about what you see with the beginning, middle, and end if you can. well, the dog is barking. that's why the why is in the tree. and the cat is in the tree. missing, i mean, the girl wants her cat. and the fire truck is there. i don't know if she's going to get the dog or the cat down, you know?

no, i... i'm comfortable talking and everything. it's building. time and stuff. yeah that makes a lot of sense. i just asked because i've i've worked with people at the page in the past on that kind of preparing a script or things to kind of yeah facilitate, but that's awesome that you've kind of built that confidence, yeah comfortable and school murray state i go to them and each time new students and i got to know them and all that. yeah. oh, that's great. yeah. so do you feel your kind of network is a little bigger than before?

what kinds of exercises? i run for about, what, twenty, forty, forty five minutes, and well, i one day i worked my arms and other day i... roscoe. legs and... well, no. yes, i do, but i forgot about... i... i... and work my arm and run some more. and then tuesday i run and work my legs and run some more. and wednesday i do cardio and thursday i'm back doing my arms and all that. okay, so kind of rotating between. well, because i was just thinking if there's any kind of like running or treadmill or biking, like a cycling group. do you enjoy cycling? well, i bike in here. there's a lot of, there's a huge trend right now with having different cycling, stationary bikes, you know? oh, yeah. so maybe that would be something where you can kind of still be fully participating without, you know, the arm and everything. it wouldn't get in the way as much. yeah. yeah. i bought some exercise tapes and rockies and ireland and alaska or no carolina and i don't i don't remember one other one. so when you pedal, it takes you through those places? yeah. yeah, i know some people who have that. that should be nice. have you ever been, or at vanderbilt, we have something called aphasia group where there's different people with aphasia that kind of all. talk together and do things together and sort of a group setting?

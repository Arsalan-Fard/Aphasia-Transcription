 So I'm just going to be asking you to do some talking. Okay. So how do you think your speech is these days? It's good, but it will be better. I can read a little bit. I have trouble with the and and the and all that. Do you remember when you had your stroke? Yeah. Could you tell me about it? Oh, gosh. Well, I got I got up to check the laundry and I got about there in the doorway of the kitchen and I don't remember. I go to Vanderbilt and that's all I can remember. What about your first memories after the stroke? I was scared. Yeah. Okay. So what about your recovery? What kinds of things have you done to try to get better since your stroke? I exercise five times a week and I have speech. Christmas break starting up next Tuesday, Wednesday, following week. And I don't know. That's it. So outside of exercising, are there any other changes in your day to day life? Oh, I can't work. I watch my grandson and that's it. I can drive now. Oh, that's great. Okay. So now I'm going to ask you to do a couple other things with talking and talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in language. So thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad. It could be from when you were a kid or more recently. I don't talk about dusting. I don't want to talk about that one. I don't know. It's a big question, kind of broad. My daughter is having twins now. May 7th. Staying with her when she has the babies and help out for a little while. I don't know. She has two kids already. A boy and a girl and having twin boy and girl. How do the siblings feel about having more kids? Hayden is excited about it, but Ben doesn't understand yet. He is the baby. How old is he? Three. Tell me about what you do when you babysit this one. I watch movies with him and he plays in his room. He's friends with Google. Best friends with the internet? Yeah. What kinds of movies do you watch? Well, Spider-Man is his thing and Sonic. I like Criminal Minds. I watch Netflix. Kingdom. Oh gosh. My Kingdom or something like that. I'm interested in it. And Peaky Blinds. I watched it and oh gosh. Dang it. I've heard I need to see that one. Oh yeah. It's good. I think me and Tom watched this two weekends. Back to back, back, back. Are there a lot of episodes? Five series. Next, 21 is the other one releasing it. Your mic fell. If you can try clipping it on, go for it. If you need a hand, let me know. Let's see. It's kind of tricky I know. It took me several tries to figure it out myself so that's why I always offer. Okay, we can put it there. That hopefully will stay. The series coming up 21, season six. I can't wait. Do you know when it comes out? I don't know. I'm trying to think. That's the British show, right? Yeah. What's it about? The family controls, I don't know what, Birmingham or something. I don't know. They mob control. Okay. Okay. I'll ask you one more question for this and then we'll go to something different. Are there any trips that you've taken with your family or for work or you can tell me about what you did? Well, I bought Tom a trip to Alaska. Oh, that's exciting. Cruise and next birthday. Oh, that's so exciting. When is the plan to go? 2010, or no, 21st week of his birthday. Have you been before? No. I have not traveled much and the first time I traveled a plane, I Vanderbilt. And I don't remember it. Really? Yeah. That was your first time? Yeah. Well, this will be so exciting then. Yeah. Okay. Have you been doing anything for the holiday? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Have you been doing anything for the holiday? Um, I went up north, Springfield, and my family lives there. My family lives up north.

And Santa Claus is my house. Rollic hit's excited? Oh yeah. Yeah. What did you have for dinner? Um, turkey and scalloped corn and stuffing and mashed potatoes and green bean casserole. And I don't think I'd have desserts. I'll have good stuff though. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think of desserts. Do you like to bake or cook? Yeah. I decorate cakes and stuff. Oh, okay. For fun or for work or for? Um, hobby I guess. And bake cookies and... I had a job at Lakeway, the dietary manager, and I used to have... My... Up north I used to CNA work and... Used to work at a bakery. Oh, okay. Cool. And you told us that you were still in speech therapy one day a week. Yeah. Yeah. Next week I will go continue it. They had a Christmas break. What are some things that you're working on in speech therapy now? Reading and writing. Counting. And I don't know. They... I... I have talked to them about cursive and stuff. I... I have a hard time printing my name and everything and I have... I have... Cursive writing is easier for me. I don't know where... Did you write in cursive a lot before? Yeah. And right-handed. Right. Yeah. Sad about it. Yeah. Is the therapy helping with that? I have botox injections on my arm... Three months daily...or three months... I don't... I don't... Every three months? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And I had a nerve conduct study in my arm and they say I'm not going to regain that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I need to do my...research my hair and stuff to put it up. Tom does it. Aww. Really sweet. I noticed two on your arm. Oh, yeah. That's really sweet. Very nice work. Yes. Tom and I got them anniversary last. Okay. And it's rings? Yeah. That's really sweet. Yeah. And he spelled my name wrong. Oh no. Wait, really? Oh, he added in that R. Oh no. What are you going to do? Yeah, I know. Oh my gosh. I was noticing I like your nails too. Do you get them done a lot? Once a month, I babysit two kids at Noah's age and he pays me to watch them and I get my nails done with that. So next, I'm just going to show you some pictures. Okay. So, take some time to look at them and I'll ask you to tell me a story with the beginning, middle and an end. Okay. And you can look at the pictures while you tell the story. Okay. That boy hit the ball through the window and I don't, well, he catched it. And he's thinking how he's going to fix the window. Yeah. Yeah. Has he ever kicked anything through your windows? No, but he, it's a ham. He, he shoots Darfs, Darfs, or Darfs, Darfs, Darfs, Darfs, Darfs, Darfs, no. Dang it. Bullets. Dart. Dart. Yeah. Dart. Yeah. It was so close. I understood what you meant. Oh, so he shoots darts. Yeah. And then those can be a little bit. Yeah. Okay. So here's some more pictures that tell a story. And again, I just want you to tell me a story with the beginning, middle and end whenever you're ready. Well, the mom has an umbrella. She didn't give it to the kid and he is, it's raining and he is wet and upset about his mother didn't give his umbrella and finally he got an umbrella. Yep. I, it was raining pretty hard the other day where we were. Was it raining for you too? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we had a tornado warning. Oh yeah. I've only seen warnings so far. Fortunately. Okay. So here's another picture. So look at everything that's happening. There's a lot. And then tell me a story about what you see. And if you can tell me a story with a beginning, middle and end. Okay. Well. The cat got on the tree and girl come over to call down the kitty cat and called his, her mom, dad to come and help and he got stuck in the tree and the dog is barking at the the man and they called the fire department to get him down and the cat. Yeah. That sounds pretty feasible for the, I think that's the best story I've heard for this picture. Got a lot going on. Okay. So for this next part, are you familiar with the story of Cinderella? Yeah. Okay. Well, so I have the picture book here if you think that'll jog your memory enough. Okay. So I'm going to have you look through the pictures and then I'll put the book away and then ask you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay. If, if going through it, you still feel like it's not coming back to you, I can look into but see if that jogs your memory. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll get that. Okay. Okay. Great. Okay. So now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can and you can use any details that you know as well as what you just saw in the picture. Okay. Okay. Wicked stepmother, two sisters and Cinderella and they, told her to clean up and they, they, she is a servant and they announced they're having a ball and the mother and step sisters, they said they, no, she couldn't go until she cleaned the whole house and stuff like that and she did that and got dressed and, and, two sisters and mother tore the gown all up and she cried and everything and they, she, fairy godmother come to see her and carriage and dressed her up and, and took her to the ball and, and, be home by hands clock strikes twelve and she ran out of the dance and lost her shoe and he, Prince, find, tried to find her and, then, they, Cinderella, tried on the shoe and, happily ever after. Yeah, yeah. Pretty comprehensive, yeah. Did it come back to you when you were looking at the pictures better? Yeah. Yeah. I always learn new parts of the story from people as they retell it and I, I didn't remember that happened. Okay, I'll ask for talking with one more thing. It's going to be a little bit different. I want you to tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, my favorite. Well, I will have the, bread and I, smear the peanut butter, one side and, other side, jelly and, stick them together. It's your favorite? Yeah. Well, I say that but, I didn't, used to use, my stroke has, got me woo-loo and I make peanut butter and jelly sandwich all the time. So, next we'll do this tag. So, next we'll do this test, which is the same one you've done in the past. It's just a different version. So, let's see. Okay. So, first, I want you to, ooh, is this a new one? Yeah. I was like, it's not been folded before. I went to fold it and it was very stiff. How? Oh. Cut off the crust. Yes. Okay, so first, what is happening in this picture? The boy is, pushing the girl on the swing. Mm-hmm. Okay, what about the next picture? Um, she is catching up with him. I guess they are, chasing each other. Mm-hmm. Okay. And each other. Whenever people have a lot to say, then I have to try even faster, but it's great. It's great. Okay. Okay, so next, I'm gonna just show you some pictures. Okay. Okay. So, show me the lion. That one. Mm-hmm. Show me the drum. That one. Show me the violin. Yep. Show me the giraffe. Yeah. Great. Okay. So we're gonna do the same thing again. Okay. New set of pictures. Okay. Show me the bone.

If I was at the park when you arrived, did I get there first? Yeah. If you're about to go upstairs, are you still downstairs? Yes. Okay. Are cats chased by mice? No. Are doctors treated by patients? No. All right. I messed up the wording on my end. Sometimes I auto- I haven't done that before, but I automatically made it right in my head. So, um, yeah, that was great. Okay. So next I'm going to have you tell me what some things are. Okay. Okay. So what is this? Dog. Mm-hmm. Pencil. Wheelchair. Mm-hmm. Octopus. Mm-hmm. Hammock. Mm-hmm. And, um, escalator. Or, no. Ah.

I didn't- I wanted to let you- yeah, but yeah, you had it. It is an escalator. Yeah. Okay. God. Okay. Um, next I'm going to have you write. I'll let you borrow this. Um, okay. So just go ahead and just write, um, what this is in that space there. Okay. Okay. Mask. Um, yeah. Yeah. Pyramid. I don't know if it's right. I don't know what spelled right. Yeah, we can look back at that one in a sec. It's really close. Um, what is happening in this one? And write a full sentence if you can. The boy boy is is giving the girl a girl. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Ooh. Yeah, that's the right letter to substitute there. Yeah, you were super, super close. It's that P-Y-R-A and then the N-I-D instead of the D-I-D. You're so close. But this is all like great for your left hand also. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that's taken some practice. Yeah. Um, and yeah, the boy give the girl a bath. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. So we'll keep going. Um, so next I'm going to have you repeat after me. Okay. Okay. House. House. Mm-hmm. Breakfast. Breakfast. Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Yeah. Yeah. That's a really hard one too. Okay. Undetectable.

It threw me off. If it was a little bit more... It threw me off. If it was a little poofier and a little blonder, it would exactly be it. It's young Trump's hair. Yeah. Okay.

Yes. I got to look back at all your old tests too, and it's amazing that just the difference, even with things like that, where it used to be more of a struggle for you, it looked like, but with this, you got all of them. I'm glad that that's making some improvements every time. Next, I'm going to have you read some stuff out loud. Let me just get... All right. Whenever you're ready, you can just read one at a time. Okay. Oh, sorry. Wire gets in the way. Ten. Doe. Proposition. Inexperienced. The baby cries in the night. The popular novelist realized why I've been calling. You said you've been working on reading too, right? Yeah. Okay. That's awesome. Those are all for the reading. All right. Next, I'm going to show you some pictures, and I want you to show me the picture that matches the word that's in the middle. Okay. For this one, show me which picture matches that word. Map. Yeah. Okay. Map. What happened with that color? It's an ugly piano, but it's a piano. Camel. Trumpet. Mm-hmm. Okay. And same thing. The cat. Oh, and there's a cat that just took pictures. That was so weird. You said it right as I looked over and saw a real-life cat. Box. Destiny's cat. Oh, mm-hmm. Cane. Socks. Mm-hmm. Are you cat sitting? No. Or... She died. She gave me the cat. Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She died. She gave me the cat. Oh, oh, oh. I gotcha. Okay. Oh, that was who you said cat. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I missed the name of which person. Oh. Okay. She seems like a sweet cat. Yeah. Yeah. She's big now. Hi, Destiny. What's her name? Baby. Baby? Hi, baby. I love cats. Are you more of a cat or dog person? Either one. I like all of them. Yeah. I love both, too. To me, it all depends on the animal. I love some cats. Don't like other cats. Love some dogs. Don't like... Just because, you know, personalities are different. Okay. Well, that's done with all of that. We just have a couple things left. Um... So first, I'm gonna do some... Ask you to do some things you've done in the past that just kind of let us see how you've been doing with your mouth. Okay. So if you could stick your... You have gum, right? Sorry. Could you stick your tongue out and move it from side to side? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. And next, I want you to say, ah, for as long as you can. Ah. Yeah, that feels weird to hold it for long. Okay. So, I'm gonna do some things that I've done in the past that I've been doing in the past. It feels weird to hold it for long. Okay. And next, um, I'd like you to say, puh. Puh-puh-puh. And then, I can tell you've done this before. And then, yeah, say it as quickly and as evenly as you can. Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh-puh. Great. Okay. Okay. And then next, we're gonna break it down first, but I think it'll be familiar probably. Um, we'll say puh. Puh. Then tuh. Tuh. And then cuh. Cuh. Mm-hmm. And then if we put it all together, pud-uh-cuh. Pud-uh-cuh. Mm-hmm. And then try and say that as evenly and as much as you can. So pud-uh-cuh, pud-uh-cuh. Pud-uh-cuh, pud-uh-cuh, pud-uh-cuh, pud-uh-cuh, pud-uh-cuh. Woo, tongue twister. Yeah, definite tongue twister. Oh. Baby. We're having all kinds of guests. Hey, it's okay. It's just not water. Unless you don't want to drink that. Okay, next, the word catastrophe. Catastrophe. Mm-hmm. And could you again repeat catastrophe? Catastrophe, catastrophe, catas-tah-stah-stah-fee, catastrophe. Mm-hmm. Catastrophe. Okay. Woo. Yeah. I know, tongue twisters. And last, can you just count to 10 at whatever pace is comfortable? A, B, C, no. One. He kind of says it. Woo. Hi. Hi. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Mm-hmm. You got it. In what way do you feel it's changed? I used to not talk at all besides Tom and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and I don't make it and all but I, I talk on the phone and I, I wouldn't make friends or nothing but people talk to me at the gym and stuff and I explain to them I have phagia and patience with me. Is that something that you worked on in therapy at all as well? No, I'm comfortable talking and everything. It's built in time and stuff. That makes a lot of sense. I just asked because I've worked with people with the phagia in the past on that kind of preparing a script or things to kind of help facilitate but that's awesome that you've kind of built that confidence Yeah. I go to Murray State and each time new students and I got to know them and all that. That's great. So do you feel your kind of networks a little bigger? Yeah. I don't have no friends yet but well gym I go to the gym but I meet them. Does your gym offer any classes that are group classes? Yeah and I tried one but I can't. I don't have movement. I have movement but push-ups and stuff like that. I don't. What do you usually do at the gym? What kind of exercises? I run 45 minutes and well one day I work my arms and other day I... Roscoe. Legs and well no. Yes I do but I forgot about I run and work my arm and run some more and then Tuesday I run and work my legs and run some more and Wednesday I do cardio and and Wednesday I back doing my arms and all that. Okay so kind of rotating between. Yeah. Well because I was just thinking if there's any kind of like running or treadmill or biking like a cycling group. Do you enjoy cycling? Well I bike in here. Oh okay. Well I know there's a lot of there's a huge trend right now with having different cycling stationary bikes. Oh yeah. So maybe that would be something where you can kind of still be fully participating without you know yeah and everything it wouldn't get in the way as much. Yeah I bought some exercise tapes and Rockies and Ireland and and I don't I don't remember one another one. So when you pedal it takes you through those places. Yeah. Yeah I know some people who have that. Yeah. Yeah. That should be nice. Do have you ever been or at Vanderbilt we have something called a phagia group where there's different people with the phagia that kind of all talk together and do things together and sort of a group setting. Is there anything like that that you know of through your where you go for speech. No I don't I don't think I don't think so. They kids mainly. Oh kids for speech you mean. Yeah. And I'm the only adult that's going. Oh wow. Okay. Is that just on the days you're there you think. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah maybe different different specialties I don't know the area super well so I don't know what would be more common or more available. Yeah. Yeah I was just trying to think of some places I know. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

So, now I'm going to ask you to do a couple other things with talking. Okay. And talk as much as you can about each one because we're really interested in language. Okay. So, thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? It could be happy or sad. It could be from when you were a kid or more recently. Oh, gosh. I don't talk about dusting. I don't want to talk about that one. I don't know. It's a big question. It's kind of broad. My daughter is having twins now. May sixth, seventh, seventh.

Yeah. Oh my gosh. I was noticing I like your nails too. Do you get them done a lot? Once a month I babysit two kids Noah's age and he pays me to watch them and I get my nails done with that. I'm just going to show you some pictures. Okay. Take some time to look at them. And I'll ask you to tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and an end. And you can look at the pictures while you tell the story. Okay. That boy hit the ball through the window and... I don't... Well, he catched it and he's thinking how he's going to fix the window. Yep, yeah. Has he ever kicked anything through your windows? No, but... He is a ham. He shoots darfs. Darfs? Darfs? No. Dang it. I know you know it. Do you want me to? Bullets. Dart. Dart. Dart. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. It was so close. I understood what you meant. But, oh, so he shoots darts. Yeah. And then those can be a little bit. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So here's some more pictures that tell a story. And again, I just want you to tell me a story with the beginning, middle, and end whenever you're ready. Well, the mom has an umbrella. She didn't give it to the kid and it's raining and he is wet. upset about his mother um didn't give his umbrella and um finally he got an umbrella yep i um it was raining pretty hard the other day where we were was it raining oh yeah yeah yeah we had a tornado warning oh yeah I've only seen warning so far. Fortunately. Okay. So here's another picture. So look at everything that's happening. There's a lot. And then tell me a story about what you see. And if you can, tell me a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Okay. Well. the cat got on the tree and girl come over to call down the kitty cat and called his her mom dad to come and help When he got stuck in the tree and the dog is barking at the man and they called the fire department to get him down and the cat. Yep. Yeah. That sounds pretty feasible for the... I think that's the best story I've heard for this picture. Got a lot going on. Okay. So for this next part, are you familiar with the story of Cinderella? Yeah. Okay. Well, so I have the picture book here, if you think that'll jog your memory enough. Okay. So I'm going to have you look through the pictures. And then I'll put the book away and ask you to tell me the story of Cinderella in your own words. Okay. If going through it, you still feel like it's not coming back to you, I can look into it, but see if that drops your memory. Okay. Okay. I'll get that. Okay. Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can, and you can use any details that you know as well as what you just saw in the picture. Okay. Wicked stepmother. two sisters and Cinderella and they Told her to clean up and they she is a servant and they announced they're having a ball and the mother and step sisters they said they know she couldn't go until she cleaned the whole house and stuff like that and she did that and got dressed and two sisters and mother tore the gown all up and she cried and everything and they she fairy godmother come to see her and Carriage and dressed her up and Took her to the ball and Be home by hands clock strikes twelve and she ran out of the dance and lost her shoe and he Prince tried to find her And then Cinderella tried on the shoe and happily ever after. Yeah, yeah. Pretty comprehensive, yeah. Did it come back to you when you were looking at the pictures better? Yeah. I always learn new parts of the story from people as they retell it, and I'm like, I didn't remember that happening. Okay. I'll ask for talking with one more thing. It's going to be a little bit different. I want you to... Tell me how you would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, my favorite.

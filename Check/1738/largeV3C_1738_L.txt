 so first i'm just gonna be asking you to do some talking. okay. so how do you think your speech is these days? very erratic. i'm close to 10 years since the stroke and i've been more or less talking for the last 7. at times this time of year i can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. other times, i'm off in the fall somewhere, about back and forth, more than others past years. so, anything else? yeah sure, so do you remember when you had your stroke? yeah. could you tell me about it? as late in december i was alone in my small house behind my, in front of my doors. and i suddenly went to, i'll say at this point, i'll say blank, but going back is far beyond this. i couldn't get a hold of myself. and i was in the house was very cold it's very messy and i sat there from somewhere between two and three days. wow. yeah. okay. eventually my daughter came in. so yeah it was really long i couldn't move yeah yeah and so how is your recovery been since then and what kinds of things have you done to try to get better since your stroke i feel very on more or less blessed by my recovery because i got up and moved eventually. months later i couldn't walk for about i think about four months, three or four months, but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and i read and i write and i draw and i walk and deal and i'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week two or three times a week. that's awesome. i love yoga too. i love yoga too. you look very sprightly. thank you. have you had any therapies after your stroke? yeah, well, one on one therapy, just sit down and not exactly, it's more or less being connected to a facial of a group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, trying to overcome certain speech difficulties. so okay that makes sense okay so now i'm gonna ask you to do a few more things where you need to talk and please talk as much as you can about each one because we really want to know more about your language okay so thinking back can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life it could be happy or sad from any time and from when you were a kid or more recently just totally at random okay and anything important to you so many different things are important to me i don't know really what to draw from but every week is i i experienced several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. so, okay, currently i think i'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country. and i'm working, i'm concentrated on something that i can do on a daily basis that takes the present out of us. and also i'm praying and talking with every people about it. so that's very current and very important at the moment. so yeah yeah yeah what about something from your life as well so something like a trip you've taken or something about your family not too many trips lately i've been thinking about a great deal i'm maybe hoping to return to california for another maybe one to two years. thanks. i'm from california. where? redondo beach. you know media and power stories right near long road down the beach. yeah. i know pv. oh, that's awesome. okay. let's see. yeah. okay. we'll go on to some picture descriptions. okay. okay, we'll go on to some picture descriptions. okay. okay, so i'm going to show you some pictures. by the way, regina is almost my favorite beach. really? long ago. what is your favorite? it's a dear for this todd. i'll think about it. okay, so it's almost your favorite but you have three favorites. so really it's like fourth place? well, it's second place. oh, okay. i have to think about it. it's long ago. yeah, i'm a big fan too. okay. why?

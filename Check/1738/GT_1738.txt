so, okay, so first i'm just gonna be asking you to do some talking. okay. so how do you think your speech is these days? very erratic. i'm close to ten years since a stroke, and i've been more or less talking for the last seven. and at times this tenth year, i can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. other times off in the fall, some were about back and forth more than of those past years. so. anything else? yeah, sure. so do you remember when you had your stroke? yeah. could you tell me about it? it was late in december. i was alone in my small house behind my front with my daughters, and i suddenly wanted to. i would say at this point, i'll say blank, but going back is far beyond this. i couldn't get a hold myself. and i was in. the house was very cold. it's very messy. and i sat there from somewhere between two and three days. wow. yeah. okay. eventually my daughter came in. it's a long time, though. yeah, it was very long. i couldn't move. yeah. yeah. and so how has your recovery been since then? and what kinds of things have you done to try to get better since your stroke? i feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because i got up and moved eventually. months later, i couldn't walk for about, i think about four months, three or four months. but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and i read and write and i draw and i'm walking dill. and i'm doing yoga at this point, about twice a week, two or three times a week, so. oh, wow, that's awesome. i love yoga too. i love yoga too. oh, yeah. okay. you look very sprightly. thank you. so let's see. have you had any therapies after your stroke? yeah, well, one on one therapy, just sit down and not exactly is more or less being connected to a facial of a group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, trying to overcome certain speech difficulties. so. okay, that makes sense. okay. so now i'm gonna ask you to do a few more things where you need to talk. and please talk as much as you can about each one because we really want to know more about your language. okay. so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? it could be happy or sad from any time and from when you were a kid or more recently, just totally at random. okay. anything important to you? so many different things are important to me. i don't know. really what to draw from. but every week is i experience several things that are important, really mind boggling important. so. okay. currently i think i'm very concerned about the national polarized mood in this country. and i'm working, i'm concentrating on something i can do on a daily basis that takes depressing me out of office and also i'm praying and charcoaling with every people about it. so that's very current and very important at the moment. so. yeah, yeah. what about something from your life as well? so something like a trip you've taken or something about your family? not too many trips lately. i've been thinking about a great deal. i may be hoping to return to california for another maybe one to two years. so i'm from california. where redondo beach. you know, media and palosuries. right near lung. rodondo beach. okay, let's see. yeah. okay, we'll go on to some picture discussions. okay, so i'm gonna show you some pictures. by the way, regina is almost, almost my beach. really long ago. what is your favorite?

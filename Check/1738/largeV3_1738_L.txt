 so first i'm just going to be asking you to do some talking. okay. so how do you think your speech is these days? very erratic. i'm close to ten years since the stroke and i've been more or less talking for the last at times this time of year i can wake up and feel fine and pronounce things very carefully. other times i'm off in the fall somewhere about back and forth. more than of those past years. so, anything else? yeah, sure. so, do you remember when you had your stroke? yeah. could you tell me about it? it was late in december. i was alone in my small house. behind my, in front of my doors. and i suddenly went, i'll say at this point, i'll say blank, but going back as far beyond this, i couldn't get ahold of myself. i was in the house. it was very cold. it was very messy. and i sat there for somewhere between two and three days. wow. yeah. okay. eventually my daughter came in. it's a long time though yeah it was very long i couldn't move yeah yeah and so how has your recovery been since then and what kinds of things have you done to try to get better since your stroke i feel very more or less blessed by my recovery because got up and moved eventually months later i couldn't walk for about i think about four months three or four months but i have been doing the things i was asked to do and and i read and i write and i draw and i walk a deal and i'm doing yoga at this point about twice a week, two or three times a week. oh, wow. that's awesome. i love yoga, too. i love yoga, too. oh, yeah, okay. you look very sprightly. thank you. so let's see. have you had any therapies after your stroke? yeah. well, one on one therapy. just sit down and not exactly. it's more or less being connected to a group, but occasionally for two or three months at a time, one on one, trying to overcome certain speech difficulties. okay, that makes sense. okay, so now i'm going to ask you to do a few more things where you need to talk and please talk as much as you can about each one because we really want to know more about your language. so thinking back, can you tell me a story about something important that happened to you in your life? it could be happy or sad from any time and from when you were a kid or more recently. just totally at random okay anything important to you so many different things are important to me i don't know really what to draw from but every week is i experienced several things that are important, really mind bogglingly important. okay, currently i think i'm very concerned about the national political mood in this country. i'm working, i'm concentrated on something that i can do on a daily basis that takes the present out of us. and also i'm praying. talking with every people about it. so that's very current and very important at the moment. yeah. yeah. what about something from your life as well? so something like a trip you've taken or something about your family? not too many trips lately. i've been thinking about it a great deal. maybe hoping to return to california for another maybe one to two years. i'm from california. where? redondo beach. you know media and power stories right near redondo beach. yeah, i know pv. okay. let's see. okay, we'll go on to some picture descriptions. okay. okay, so i'm going to show you some pictures. by the way, regina is almost my favorite beach. really? long ago. what is your favorite? it's a deer for this tide. i'll think about it. okay. almost your favorite, but you have three favorites. so really it's like fourth place. well, it's second place. oh, okay. i have to think about it. it's long ago. yeah, i'm a big fan too. okay. wide. it used to be very wide. i hadn't been there for a while. yeah. yeah, it's close to hermosa, manhattan, all those others too. i have a first cousin living on the beach in hermosa beach. oh, yeah, that's one of my favorites is hermosa. okay, so... okay, well... boy is kicking the ball. it's going through the window. it's dropping next to a young, older man who grabs the ball and lets it out through the window. that's basic. yeah, you got it. yeah, okay. so, here are some more pictures that tell a story. take a look at all of them, and then again i'll ask for a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, and you can look at the pictures to tell the story. he has no umbrella from the mother. he says goodbye, goes out and starts raining. he runs back. it's all wet. the mother looks at him a bit scoldingly. so he takes the umbrella and he walks. to school, i guess. and restored. yep, yep. i like that one. it's very mother knows best. okay. okay. i've got, i believe, one more picture for you. okay. okay. so... again, just look at everything that's happening, and then tell me about a story, or tell me a story about what you see. and again, try and make it a story with a beginning, middle, and end. again, very basically. the little girl is trying to reach the kitty cat in the branches. there's a letter and a child next to her. closer to the tree. as a forlorn looking man looking out as the dog barks up at him and the two firemen are running with another letter from the fired truck to put the letter up and write to the man and it's a bird sitting of open singing to heavens i'm just sorry. yeah, you covered everything so i was trying. yeah, you were very thorough. close. yeah. okay. so for this next part, have you heard of the story of cinderella?
